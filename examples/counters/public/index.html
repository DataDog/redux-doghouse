      <h1>Redux-Doghouse - Counters</h1>
      <p>
        Each counter is written as if it were a tiny Redux app that can dispatch and reduce for
        <span class="code">INCREMENT</span> and <span class="code">DECREMENT</span>
        actions.
      </p>
        Redux-Doghouse prevents <span class="code">+</span> or <span class="code">-</span> button-clicks on one
        counter to affect all of the others, but allows the row of buttons below to increment or
        decrement multiple counters at a time.
